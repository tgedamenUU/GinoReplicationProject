        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          This block covers <strong>Study 3</strong> and <strong>Study 4</strong>, which focus on
          how men and women evaluate leadership roles in terms of desirability and attainability.

        <h2>Original studies</h2>

        <h3>Study 3 – MBA alumni</h3>
        <p>
MBA alumni rated how desirable and attainable they perceived high-level leadership roles to be.
Desirability captured how attractive they found such roles; attainability assessed whether they believed people like them could realistically obtain such positions.

Main finding:
Men and women found leadership roles similarly desirable,
but women rated them as significantly less attainable.
This suggested that perceived barriers, rather than interest, may explain gender gaps.
        </p>

        <h3>Study 4 – Online sample</h3>
        <p>
An independent online sample completed the same desirability and attainability ratings.

Main finding:
The key pattern replicated:
	•	Attainability gap: Women again perceived leadership as less attainable.
	•	Desirability: Little to no gender difference.

This reinforced the idea that perceived access—not interest—is central to gender differences in leadership motivation.        </p>

        <h2>Replication protocol</h2>

        <h3>Required variables</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Desirability rating(s) for leadership roles</li>
          <li>Attainability rating(s) for leadership roles</li>
          <li>Gender, age, education, employment / student status</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Required analyses</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Gender differences in attainability</li>
          <li>Gender differences in desirability</li>
          <li>Effect sizes and, optionally, models where attainability predicts leadership interest</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Exploratory add-ons</h3>
        <p>
          Student teams may include additional measures (e.g., leadership self-efficacy, perceived barriers,
          stereotype endorsement) and exploratory analyses, documented on OSF.
