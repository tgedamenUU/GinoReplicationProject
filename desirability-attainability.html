        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          This block covers <strong>Study 3</strong> and <strong>Study 4</strong>, which focus on how men and women
          evaluate leadership roles in terms of <em>desirability</em> and <em>attainability</em>. The central question
          is whether gender differences in leadership motivation come from differences in interest, differences in
          perceived access, or both.

        <h2>Original studies (Gino et al.)</h2>

        <h3>Study 3 – MBA alumni sample</h3>
        <p>
          Study 3 surveyed MBA alumni from a U.S. business school. Participants rated how
          <em>desirable</em> and how <em>attainable</em> they perceived high-level leadership roles to be.
          Desirability captured how attractive they found such positions; attainability assessed whether
          they believed people like them could realistically obtain these roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Main finding.</strong> Men and women reported similar levels of desirability for leadership roles,
          but women rated leadership positions as <em>less attainable</em>. This suggested that gender differences in
          leadership motivation may be driven more by perceived barriers than by differences in interest.
        </p>

        <h3>Study 4 – Online panel replication</h3>
        <p>
          Study 4 replicated the same basic design in an independent online sample. Participants again rated
          both the desirability and the attainability of leadership roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Main finding.</strong> The key pattern from Study 3 replicated: women perceived leadership as less
          attainable than men, while desirability ratings were similar or showed smaller differences. This reinforced
          the idea that perceived access to leadership roles is central to understanding gender gaps in leadership
          motivation.

    <!-- Replication protocol -->

        <h2>Replication protocol</h2>
        <p>
          This block uses a shared protocol to replicate Studies 3 and 4 in new samples. Pre-registration is not
          required; student teams follow the protocol and document deviations and exploratory work on OSF and in
          the replication quality checklist.
        </p>

        <h3>Required variables</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Desirability rating(s) for leadership roles (e.g., “How desirable is it for you to hold such a role?”).</li>
          <li>Attainability rating(s) for leadership roles (e.g., “How attainable is this role for someone like you?”).</li>
          <li>Gender and basic demographics (age, education, employment or student status).</li>
          <li>
            Optional but recommended: measures of leadership interest or intention to pursue leadership roles.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Required analyses</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Test gender differences in attainability ratings.</li>
          <li>Test gender differences in desirability ratings.</li>
          <li>
            Report effect sizes (e.g., Cohen’s d or regression coefficients) and confidence intervals when possible.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Exploratory add-ons</h3>
        <p>
          Student teams may include additional measures, such as leadership self-efficacy, perceived promotion
          barriers, stereotype endorsement, or organisational identification. Exploratory analyses can examine,
          for example, whether these variables predict desirability or attainability ratings, or moderate gender
          differences. All such additions must be clearly labelled as exploratory on OSF.
