        <p>
          The <strong>Gino Replication Project</strong> is a multi-year initiative in which student
          research teams and collaborators systematically replicate the nine studies reported in
          Gino, Wilmuth &amp; Brooks (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
          The project is organised into four conceptual blocks:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Life goals</strong> (Studies 1–2)</li>
          <li><strong>Desirability vs attainability</strong> (Studies 3–4)</li>
          <li><strong>Expected outcomes of promotion</strong> (Studies 5–7)</li>
          <li><strong>Power &amp; conflict framing</strong> (Studies 8–9)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each block has its own page with study descriptions, a shared replication protocol,
          and a cumulative overview of results.
        </p>

        <h2>Project goals</h2>
        <p>
          The project aims to evaluate the robustness of key findings on gender and leadership motivation,
          train students in open and cumulative science, and build a transparent record of all replications
          suitable for future meta-analyses.
        </p>
        <div class="note">
          This project is coordinated by <strong>Tom Damen</strong>, university lecturer and researcher
          in Social, Health &amp; Organisational Psychology at <strong>Utrecht University</strong>.
          His work focuses on leadership, social identity, and the role of AI and reproducibility in education.
