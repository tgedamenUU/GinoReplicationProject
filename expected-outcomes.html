        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          This block covers <strong>Studies 5–7</strong>, which investigate how men and women differ in their
          expectations about the <em>positive</em> and <em>negative</em> consequences of being promoted into a
          leadership role. The central idea is that women may anticipate more costs (e.g., conflict, stress,
          work–life strain), which can reduce their motivation to pursue leadership.

        <h2>Original studies (Gino et al.)</h2>

        <h3>Study 5 – Working adults imagining a promotion</h3>
        <p>
          In Study 5, working adults imagined being promoted into a leadership role. They then rated how likely
          various <em>positive outcomes</em> (e.g., growth, recognition, impact) and <em>negative outcomes</em>
          (e.g., stress, conflict, work–family interference) would be if they accepted the promotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Main finding.</strong> Women anticipated more negative outcomes than men, even when positive
          expectations were similar. These more negative expectations were associated with lower motivation to
          pursue leadership roles.
        </p>

        <h3>Study 6 – Executive sample</h3>
        <p>
          Study 6 replicated the imagined-promotion scenario with senior executives. They evaluated similar sets of
          positive and negative outcomes of accepting a leadership promotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Main finding.</strong> The gender pattern from Study 5 replicated among high-level professionals:
          women expected more negative consequences of leadership roles than men, suggesting that these expectations
          are not limited to early-career or student samples.
        </p>

        <h3>Study 7 – Undergraduate students</h3>
        <p>
          Study 7 adapted the scenario for undergraduate students, who imagined being promoted into a campus
          leadership role. Students rated anticipated positive and negative outcomes, and reported their interest
          in pursuing such leadership positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Main finding.</strong> Negative expectations were a strong predictor of lower leadership interest
          among women. In mediation analyses, negative outcomes partially accounted for gender differences in
          leadership motivation.

    <!-- Replication protocol -->
    <section class="section section-alt">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Replication protocol</h2>
        <p>
          Replications in this block follow a shared protocol. Student teams adapt the scenario to their context
          (e.g., workplace, student organisation) while preserving the core structure of positive and negative
          outcome expectations.
        </p>

        <h3>Required variables</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Positive outcome ratings for the imagined promotion into a leadership role.</li>
          <li>Negative outcome ratings for the same scenario.</li>
          <li>Gender and basic demographics (e.g., age, occupational / study status).</li>
          <li>Optional but recommended: leadership interest or willingness to accept the promotion.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Required analyses</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Test gender differences in negative outcome expectations.</li>
          <li>Test gender differences in positive outcome expectations.</li>
          <li>
            If leadership interest is measured, examine whether negative outcomes predict leadership interest
            and whether this relationship differs by gender.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Exploratory add-ons</h3>
        <p>
          Exploratory extensions might include measures of burnout expectations, work–life balance concerns,
          leadership self-efficacy, or social identity. These variables can be used to test additional mediators
          or moderators of the link between gender and leadership motivation. All such work must be clearly
          labelled as exploratory and documented on OSF.
