          This page is for student teams and collaborators who have completed a replication study
          within one of the four blocks (Life goals, Desirability vs attainability, Expected outcomes,
          Power &amp; conflict).
        </p>
        <p>
          Before completing the submission form, make sure that:
        </p>
        <ul class="form-list">
          <li>You have followed the official replication protocol for your chosen block as closely as possible.</li>
          <li>You have created an OSF project or component for your replication.</li>
          <li>Your data are de-identified and uploaded to OSF.</li>
          <li>Your analysis code and additional materials are uploaded to OSF.</li>
          <li>You clearly label exploratory variables and analyses on OSF.</li>

        <h2>Quality criteria for inclusion</h2>
        <p>
          All replications included on this website are screened using a short quality checklist.
          We do not require preregistration. Instead, we use a transparent protocol-compliance check:
        </p>
        <ul class="form-list">
          <li>The official replication protocol for the selected block was followed, or deviations are documented.</li>
          <li>Original OSF materials were used (survey, coding template, instructions), or justified adaptations are described.</li>
          <li>Primary analyses follow the protocol.</li>
          <li>Exploratory variables and analyses are clearly labeled.</li>
          <li>All materials, data, and code are uploaded to OSF.</li>
          <li>Sample size is sufficient for the core analyses (flexible across student cohorts).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Student teams complete this checklist at submission; the project coordinator reviews it before adding
          the replication to the public record.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may also provide the checklist as a PDF template for students to download:
          <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Add checklist PDF link here</a>.

        <h2>Open submission form</h2>
        <p>
          Once your OSF project is complete and you have all information ready, open the submission form below.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a class="btn" href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Add submission form link here</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          Submissions will be screened by the project coordinator. After verification, your replication will be
          added to the relevant block page.
