        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          This block covers <strong>Study 1</strong> and <strong>Study 2</strong> of Gino et al. (2015).
          Both studies examined whether leadership emerges as part of people’s long-term life goals,
          and whether there are systematic gender differences in the presence of leadership-related goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          All project materials and replication resources for this block are available on OSF:

        <h2>Original studies (Gino et al.)</h2>

        <h3>Study 1 – Life goals in working adults</h3>
        <p>
          In Study 1, working adults recruited online were asked to freely list their most important
          long-term life goals in an open-ended format. Independent coders then classified whether
          any of these goals reflected <em>leadership aspirations</em>, such as becoming a manager,
          leading a team, or holding a position of influence at work.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Main finding.</strong> Men were significantly more likely than women to spontaneously
          include leadership-related goals. This suggested that gender differences in leadership motivation
          already appear at the level of broad personal ambitions and self-generated life priorities.
        </p>

        <h3>Study 2 – Conceptual replication with refined coding</h3>
        <p>
          Study 2 used a similar online sample and the same open-ended life goal task, but with a refined
          coding scheme to improve reliability. Participants again listed their life goals, and coders again
          evaluated whether leadership aspirations were present.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Main finding.</strong> The gender difference observed in Study 1 replicated: women were
          less likely than men to mention leadership as part of their life goals. This reinforced the idea
          that early, self-defined life goals may contribute to gender gaps in leadership motivation.

    <!-- Replication protocol -->
    <section class="section section-alt">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Replication protocol</h2>
        <p>
          Replications in this block follow a shared protocol to ensure comparability across cohorts.
          Pre-registration is not required; instead, teams follow the protocol and document any deviations
          in their OSF project and in the replication quality checklist.
        </p>

        <h3>Required variables</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Open-ended life goal responses (in the original language of data collection).</li>
          <li>
            Coding of whether each participant listed at least one leadership-related goal,
            using the shared coding scheme.
          </li>
          <li>Participant gender, age, education, and employment status.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Required analyses</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Test for gender differences in the likelihood of listing leadership-related goals
            (e.g., logistic regression or χ² test).
          </li>
          <li>
            Report effect sizes (e.g., odds ratios, Cohen’s d based on proportions, or regression coefficients),
            and confidence intervals whenever possible.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Exploratory add-ons</h3>
        <p>
          Student teams may add extra variables and exploratory analyses, such as self-determination theory
          measures (autonomy, competence, relatedness), leadership self-efficacy, or social identity scales.
          All additional variables and analyses must be clearly labelled as exploratory and documented on OSF.
