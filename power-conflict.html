        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          This block covers <strong>Studies 8–9</strong>, which investigate how different ways of framing conflict
          in leadership roles influence leadership interest among men and women. The key question is whether
          presenting conflict as an opportunity rather than a burden can reduce gender gaps in leadership motivation.

        <h2>Original studies (Gino et al.)</h2>

        <h3>Study 8 – Conflict framing in an online experiment</h3>
        <p>
          In Study 8, participants read a short description of a leadership role that involved dealing with conflict.
          The description was framed in different ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>a more neutral or burden-focused frame (conflict as a difficult and draining part of leadership),</li>
          <li>versus more opportunity-focused frames (conflict as a chance to learn, grow, and create positive change).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After reading the description, participants rated how willing they would be to pursue such a role.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Main finding.</strong> Women showed higher leadership interest when conflict was framed positively
          as an opportunity, but lower interest when it was framed as a burden or primarily as a source of strain.
          Men’s interest was less sensitive to the framing. This suggested that reframing conflict may be a promising
          intervention to increase women’s leadership motivation.
        </p>

        <h3>Study 9 – Executive sample</h3>
        <p>
          Study 9 replicated the conflict-framing paradigm among executives. Participants again read differently
          framed descriptions of leadership roles that involve conflict and rated their willingness to accept such roles.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Main finding.</strong> The positive impact of opportunity-focused conflict frames generalised to
          high-level professionals. Framing effects were again stronger for women than for men, supporting the idea
          that how we talk about conflict in leadership can shape gender differences in leadership interest.

    <!-- Replication protocol -->

        <h2>Replication protocol</h2>
        <p>
          Replications in this block implement the conflict framing manipulation in new samples. The wording can
          be adapted slightly to the context (e.g., student leadership roles, organisational roles) while preserving
          the contrast between burden-focused and opportunity-focused descriptions.
        </p>

        <h3>Required variables</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Condition / frame (categorical variable indicating which description or framing participants received).
          </li>
          <li>Leadership interest or willingness to pursue / accept the described role.</li>
          <li>Gender and basic demographics (age, occupational or study status).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Required analyses</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Test the interaction between frame and gender on leadership interest (e.g., ANOVA or regression with
            interaction term).
          </li>
          <li>
            Conduct follow-up comparisons if appropriate (e.g., simple effects of frame within gender, where justified).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Exploratory add-ons</h3>
        <p>
          Exploratory measures may include manipulation checks (perceived conflict, perceived opportunity), leadership
          self-efficacy, gender role identification, organisational identification, or open-ended responses about how
          participants interpret conflict in leadership. These variables can be used to test mediators (e.g., perceived
          opportunity) or moderators of the framing effect.
